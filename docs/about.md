### About Me

Hey there! I’m Rohan Nayakanti, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for tackling challenges in digital forensics, ethical hacking, and cryptography. Currently studying Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Cybersecurity, I dive deep into everything from Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges to hands-on projects in Web3, blockchain, and mobile forensics. I love sharing my journey, insights, and projects, especially those that bridge theory with real-world applications, like building custom network security tools and exploring generative AI.

Beyond the tech realm, I’m a gaming enthusiast and PC builder, always on the lookout for new games and tech innovations. Through this blog, I aim to share knowledge, tips, and guides for anyone interested in cybersecurity, coding, and the rapidly evolving tech world. Let’s learn and grow together!
